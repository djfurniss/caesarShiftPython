# Caesar Shift Encryption/Decription code

This derived from an earlier project, [Decoder Ring](https://github.com/djfurniss/decoder-ring). That project was done in JavaScript while I was enrolled in bootcamp. Now that I'm graduated, I decided to learn Python. 


So here you have it, the same functionality as the Caesar shift in my Decoder Ring project but in a different language, a language that I learned on my own. This was super fun and cool to do. I already had the concept in my head but the excecution and syntax from another language is amazing to see. 

I look forward to more Python projects both big and small in the near future!
